Creating a simple document

Anatomy
  every document begins with @code{\documentclass[<options>]@{<class name>@}}
  the contents of the document goes within the document environment
  everything after @code{\end@{document@}} is ignored
  before the document environment, we can declare custom commands we will use. 
  Such commands can be imported from other files via usepackage
