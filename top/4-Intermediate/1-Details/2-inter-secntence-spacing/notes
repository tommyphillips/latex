french spacing uses 1 standard space@*
english spacing uses 1 en-space (slightly larger than 1 standard space)@*
tex defaults to english, which is better@*
\frenchspacing \nonfrenchspacing  declare toggle french spacing@*

if we have a . ? or !, but it is not at the end of a sentence, then we must escape the en space@*
eg  e.g.\ like this@*
if a we have a capital letter followed by . ? or !, latex assumes it is not the end of the sentence, so we must escape it@*
eg Yesterday, I saw my G.P\@@.@*

Note: in a typewriter font, \nonfrenchspacing uses a double-space to simulate the en space@*
