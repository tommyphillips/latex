Lengths
  a length register stores dimensions (eg 1in, 2pt)@*
  length reisters are specified as \[AZaz]*@*
  they determine page layouts (eg \par indentation ~ \parindent)@*
  use em for widths and ex for heights@*

  change a length register's stored dimension using \setlength@{<register>@}@{<length>@}@*
  eg \setlength@{\parindent@}@{0pt@}@*
  or \addtolength@{<register>@}@{<length>@}@*

  display within the document text the length register's stored dimension using \the<register> @*
  eg \the\parindent @*

  a rubber length is a length that has some elasticity@*
  tex can vary the length to get the text as flushed with the margins as possible@*
  eg \setlength@{\parskip@}@{10pt plus 1pt minus 1pt@}@*
  explicitly changing \parskip can cause problems@*

  the easiest way to change page layout lengths is with the geometry package@*
  \usepackage[body=@{6.5in, 8.75in@}, left=0.4in]@{geometry@}@*
