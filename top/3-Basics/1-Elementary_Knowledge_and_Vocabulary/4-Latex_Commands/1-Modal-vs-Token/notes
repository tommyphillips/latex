Modal commands are effective for the remainder of their block. They can be localised with:
@itemize
@item Standard grouping - @code{@{\itshape <text>@}} 
@item Environment grouping - @code{\begin@{itshape@}<text>\end@{itshape@}}
@end itemize

Token commands operate on a set number of mandatory arguments/tokens following the command.
For example, token commands with a mandatory argument take the next token as their argument.
Usually, this token is a @code{@{@}} block.

@subsubheading Note
Commands expecting no argument interpret @code{@{@}} as simply a block occuring after the command was made.@*
This can be used to create 'meaningful' whitespace after such a command. eg @code{\lambda@{@}}.
