After the @code{\documentclass[options]@{class@}} command,
and before @code{\begin@{document@}} (the start of the document environment),

Most commands must come within the document environment, including all commands that generate text (eg @code{\maketitle}).@*
Some commands can be within the document or the preamble (eg @code{\title}).@*
A few commands can only come within the preamble (eg @code{\usepackage}).@*
