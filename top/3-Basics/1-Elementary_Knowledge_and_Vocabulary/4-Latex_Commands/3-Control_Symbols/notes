A control symbol is a @code{\} followed by a non-alphabet symbol.@*
Because we know the length of a control symbol is one, we don't need a space to signal the end.
Therefore, whitespace after a control symbol is significant.@*

Starred control symbols are a special type of control symbol.@* 
For example, @code{\\*} forces line break that cannot go over a page.
