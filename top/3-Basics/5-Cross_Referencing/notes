Cross-referencing
  @code{\label@{<unique>@}} should be placed at the point you want to label
  @code{\ref@{<unique>@}} is then used to refer to the chapter/section number containing the label
  @code{\pageref@{<unique>@}} is used to refer to the page containing the label
 
  Note: dont start a line with a number - use unbreakable space - Section~\ref@{sec:results@}

  You can use labels and refs within an enunmerate environment to refer to steps in the numbered list
  
  similar to TOC, the refs may be invoked before the labels
  latex reads from the .aux file, needs two runs
  undefined refs show up as ?? in output
  if you get an 'undefined reference' warning on a re-run, then you have used a \ref to a \label that does not exist

  rare situations involving cross referencing and TOCs can require three runs
  latexmk is a perl script that runs latex the required number of times
