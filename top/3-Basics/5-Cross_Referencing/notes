Place @code{\label@{<unique>@}} at the point you want to label.@*
Use @code{\ref@{<unique>@}} to refer to the chapter/section/enumerate number containing the label.@*
Use @code{\pageref@{<unique>@}} to refer to the page containing the label.

Good form: use unbreakable space - @code{Section~\ref@{sec:results@}}

Implementation

References may be invoked before labels.@*
@code{latex} reads from @file{.aux}, needs two runs.@*
Undefined refs print as @code{??}.@*
See TOC implementation.

Note:@*
Rare situations involving cross referencing and TOCs can require three runs.@*
@code{latexmk} is a perl script that runs latex the required number of times.@*
If you get an @code{undefined reference} warning on a re-run,
you must have @code{\ref}ed a @code{\label} that does not exist.
