TOC
  \tableofcontents   using all the sectioning commands in the document
                     use it after \maketitle
                     KOMA-Script classes have the optional argument toc=graduated(default)|flat
  as latex processes source code sequentially, it knows not the sectioning when it reads the toc
  as latex reads the sectioning, it writes a .toc file 
  when latex reads \tableofcontents, it reads in the .toc file
  hence, two runs are required to fully update the toc

  starred sections need to be manually added to the toc if desired
  the @code{\addcontentsline@{<file format>@}@{<section unit>@}@{<text>@}} is used for this purpose
  eg. @code{\chapter*@{Acknowledgements@}}
      @code{\addcontentsline@{toc@}@{chapter@}@{Acknowledgements@}}   chapter arg ~ \chapter
