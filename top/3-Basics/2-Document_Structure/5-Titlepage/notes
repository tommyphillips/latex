Titlepage requires at least the following info to be entered:
  @code{\author@{@}}
  @code{\title@{@}}
  They can also facilitate more info:
    @code{\date@{@}}     if not provided, current date used by default, use empty @code{\date@{@}} to suppress
    KOMA-Script
@verbatim
      \titlehead{}
      \subject{}
      \subtitle{}
      \publishers{}
@end verbatim
  These commands do not print to the document, and hence may be placed in the preamble
  Useful commands in this context:
    @code{\and}    for specifying multiple authors
    @code{\thanks@{<text>@}}   for a special footnote  @code{<text>} is a moving argument
